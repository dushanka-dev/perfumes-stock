# PERFUME STOCK APP

Perfume Stock is a Inventory app designed for businesses which handles inventory on day to day basis. 

The inspiration for this app came from a friend of mine who work for a Luxury French perfume company. She's a Sales Manager. Every day she performs same reptetive tasks. 

Perfume Stock App was born. 

Perfume Stock App has four main features: Add Sales Units, View Current Stock, View Warehouse Stock and Sell-Through Rate.

The app is connected to Google sheets via API. Google worksheets include: Daily sales, Store stock and Warehouse stock.

This app is not just for sales people. It's very useful for stock staff and warehouse staff. They will have their own worksheets updated so it saves time by not having to update worksheets manually.

When user adds a sale unit, all worksheets gets updated in real-time.
